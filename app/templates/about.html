                <h2>About this Project</h2>
                <p>The data set used in this project is the UK MOT data set. This is part of the UK government's open data initiative, and is accessible <a href="http://data.gov.uk/dataset/anonymised_mot_test/">here</a>. The purpose of the MOT test is to ensure that all vehicles over a prescribed age (3 years for domestic cars) are checked at least once a year to ensure that they comply with key roadworthiness and environmental requirements as prescribed by the law. For each test an entry is made in the dataset containing the car details, test outcome and the fault(s) detected. The vehicle testing data currently available on the government website spans 9 years, from 2005 to 2013 and amounts to 800 million rows.</p>
                <p>This project is part of my MSc Data Science programme at Lancaster University.The key deliverable of the project is this website which provides an interactive view for users to access the large wealth of data available. It is aimed at providing information on the pass rates, top faults discovered at MOT test, and the detailed descriptions of these faults as a function of the vehicle make, model and year of production.</p>                
                <p>Special thanks to Ian Hopkinson my project supervisor and Amit Chopra my academic supervisor. Many thanks to Steve, Peter and Dragon at ScraperWiki, who were always available and helped out when I ran into knotty technical challenges, and additionally provided a plethora of tips and tricks. And great thanks to Aidan, Aine and Francis at ScraperWiki for their unique style of leadership (leadership by friendliness). I had a great time and if given the opportunity, I'll do it again!</p>
                <p>The project is in three parts - data infrastructure, analysis and presentation, described in more detail below.</p>

                <h2>Data Infrastructure</h2>
                <p>Data were collected from the MOT website, this was straightforward although time consuming due to the shear volume. The documentation was sufficient but given the size and complexity of the data set it took some experimentation with a range of data analysis tools in order to establish the most appropriate infrastructure to process the data.</p>
                <p>Once the structure of the data was clear and the general direction of the analysis was established, work began on the aggregating of the data for the 9 years (2005 to 2013 inclusive), and the resulting data was over 800 million rows in total. The data were condensed using a high-end AWS PostgreSQL server instance to generate a summary dataset of 6 million rows which is used to power this website.</p>

                <h2>Data Analysis</h2>
                <p>This was the part of the project where we explored the data set. For example, we wanted to know the pass rate for each model. To do this we grouped the data by make, model, year, and test outcome (pass or fail). Calculating the most common faults was not trivial. The information about the car makes and models was in one table, the test failure items was in another, and the information about the hierarchy of faults used in the MOT was in a further table.</p>
                <p>We needed to collate the data in each table into one table with all the fields of interest, this simplified analysis and enabled us to concentrate on data presentation.</p>

                <h2>Data Presentation</h2>
                <p>We wanted to make the data available in a way that was easy and accessible for non-technical users. We came up with this website, which presents users with a simple form to select car make, model and year before showing them data on failure rates and failure types for the selected vehicles. You can find out more about how to use the website and how it is built in <a href="https://blog.scraperwiki.com/2015/08/which-car-should-i-not-buy-find-out-with-the-scraperwiki-mot-website/">this blog post</a>.</p>
